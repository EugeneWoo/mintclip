One significant red flag is when candidates with a machine learning science background assume their existing AI expertise is enough for a product management role, without demonstrating a strong grasp of core product management skills like focusing on users and use cases. Another point is that while technical backgrounds can be helpful, especially for AI builder PM roles, candidates should still emphasize their product craft.",
